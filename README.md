# Who Plays When?

### Because who wants to keep checking their phone to find out?

**Disclaimer**: please excuse the current state of this project as it was not planned for release and therefore was not maintained. I have no real intentions of optimizing this, or making it faster/more efficient. I know it's super bloated but it runs automatically once a day for me, so I'm not really worried about the efficiency of the code. I'll get back to cleaning it up eventually.


## How it works:

1. Configure teams you want to follow in `config.py` (follow along with the instructions documented in that file)
    - Currently works as intended with the following professional sports leagues: NBA, MLB, NHL, NFL, and the EPL.
2. Replace the temporary email in the `gmail.txt` file to the email you want to be notified on
3. Run it, or set it up seperately to run automatically (I have it running on a Heroku server once a day to remind me of what games are upcoming)

## Future Plans

1. Better way for someone else to run this on their own if they wanted to
